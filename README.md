Hi, I’m Mihir and I'd like to welcome you to my GitHub Repository.
   
A little bit about myself:
- 📚 I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. 
- 🧑‍🎓 I consider myself to be a life-long learner with a passion for coding, mathematics and physics. 
- 🧑‍💻 I’m interested in designing software and hardware applications and learning new tools and frameworks.
- 🏁 My goal is to help do my part in making the world a better place by using my skills in software to help people learn by making knowledge accessible online

Although I'm at the beginning of my career, I aim to educate myself about software and hardware and share my progress here. 
Feel free to give any constructive criticism or suggestions on what I should do/learn next!
